# At first we used `==` to compare two paths and it causes the problem
# when you change only the cases of filename (.e.g. abc -> Abc).
# Then we added this test case as a regression test, but this test passes
# without any fixes. We assume this is because the 'ignorecase' option is off
# during the test but `set ignorecase` does not work.
# Anyway, we remain this test.
